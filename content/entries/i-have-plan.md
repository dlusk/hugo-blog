**Guys, Arkansas sucks.** But before I go and start offending _everybody_, let's address the proverbial elephant in the room. This "blog" is called Dan Has Plan. I live in a car that is conveniently named an "Element" and so while it would be _facile_ to adopt an obvious title riffing off of various puns about elements and how I may or may not be in one, I would not stoop so low. Moreso, and let this be the bottom line:

**I have plan.**

Back to Arkansas, but let's start with Memphis. Memphis is the current domain of THE Griffin Smith. Patient Zero, one might say. In visiting a Griffin Smith, one can only spend so much time in a Griffin Smith's house before ze begins to _be_ a Griffin Smith in mind, body, and spirit (not a _bad_ thing, just a _different_ thing), and this is important for the visitor to know because, much like death by carbon monoxide poisoning, _becoming_ a Griffin Smith is a subtle but effective process. Signs of the transformation include:

- Asking for just one bite or sip
- Watching TVs that are on the ceiling with no issue whatsoever
- Sprawling
- Waking up early and asking that all other Griffin Smiths do the same
- Fastidiously organizing half of one's things
- Being an exemplary friend <3
- Wearing criminally loose socks

And humans are not the only vectors for this transformation--non-humans are susceptible as well. It was clear that in this particular Griffin Smith's house there were at least five others living there as well (I believe that two lived in the crawlspace beneath the house).

Now, when one begins to _be_ a Griffin Smith, ze begins to think like one, and therefore becomes receptive to ideas like making the first destination of a life-changing and deeply significant Road Trip **Hot Springs, Arkansas**. Decisions like these are not necessarily wrong, but they are certainly not correct. And it is here that I would like to confess to an infliction of my own.

**I have no plan and in this I have lost all control.**

You may find that the words of this "blog" are contradictory, but you must not accept it. In the particularly relevant words of George Orwell, it will be necessary "to forget whatever it [is] necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment it [is] needed, and then promptly to forget it again." In this "blog" we will "use logic against logic", and we will not even know it, as it will be purely emotional. Case in point: to arrive in Hot Springs is to leave Hot Springs. Like after two hours because damn that place has some _vibes_. Get out and stay vibes. Become us and live to die vibes. Nuh-uh. Let's go to Houston.
